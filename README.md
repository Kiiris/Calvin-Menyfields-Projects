# Tic-Tac-Toe

## ***Description***
[Tic Tac Toe](https://foregoing-star.surge.sh/)

A simplistic Tic-Tac-Toe game I built in my first week learning Javascript. Users can play one at a time and can reset at any point during the game. Scorekeeping system that keeps tracks of O wins, X wins, and ties.

# Quiz Game

## ***Description***
[Quiz Game](lumpy-tree.surge.sh)

A boot camp-centric personality test that helps you determine what learning style you have. This sifts through questions as they are answered, keeping track of the players score, and at the end of it gives you a learning style which gives you insight on a good way to learn coding better!
